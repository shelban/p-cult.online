# Product Guidelines — p-cult.space

## Voice and Tone

Informal, personal, expressive. Mixed Ukrainian/Russian/English as natural — not forced into any single language. No corporate polish. Direct, sometimes profane, always genuine.

## Design Principles

1. **Chaos over conformity** — Distinctive "ADHD Energy Maximalism" aesthetic. Rotations, glitch effects, neon on dark. Never generic or Bootstrap-looking.
2. **Dark only** — No light mode, no toggle. Neon palette requires dark background.
3. **Content-first** — Decoratives enhance, never obstruct. Mobile strips rotations for readability.
4. **Zero JavaScript** — Pure HTML+CSS output. No client-side frameworks.
5. **No placeholders** — Never invent data. If content is missing, say so.

## Anti-patterns

- Light mode or system-preference theme switching
- Generic component libraries (Bootstrap, Tailwind)
- JavaScript-heavy interactions
- Invented timestamps, fake stream metadata, hallucinated avatars
