## Project Name

p-cult.space ("культивація особів")

## Description

Personal website for Iv (she/her) — Twitch Just Chatting streamer. Hub for streams archive, friends list, and support/donation page.

## Problem Statement

Streamers need a personal branded hub that isn't constrained by Twitch/YouTube UI — a place to archive VODs, showcase community, and accept support directly.

## Target Users

- Viewers who want to browse past stream VODs with timestamps
- Friends and collaborators listed on the site
- Anyone looking to support the streamer

## Key Goals

1. Archive streams with searchable timestamps linking directly to YouTube VOD moments
2. Showcase friends/community with randomized discovery
3. Provide multiple support/donation options (crypto, direct platforms)
4. Maintain distinctive chaos aesthetic as a personal brand identity
